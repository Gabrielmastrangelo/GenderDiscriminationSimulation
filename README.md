# About the Repository
The simulation has as motivation one class from the STAT 205 course at Capilano University taught by Dr. Mahshid Atapour, where the present study was introduced to the students, and the notion of simulation using a deck of cards.

# Introduction

A study on gender discrimination conducted in 1972 involved 48 male bank supervisors being presented with identical personnel files and asked to evaluate if the person was suitable for a branch manager position described as "routine." Half of the supervisors were given files with a male candidate, while the other half were given files with a female candidate, with the allocation randomly determined. Out of the 48 files assessed, 35 were recommended for promotion. The study aimed to determine if there was any unfair discrimination against women.
